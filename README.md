To get this script to work easily on your machine:
1. Install Anaconda
2. Download environment.yml
3. Open Anaconda Prompt
4. make sure that enviornment.yml is located in the same location
5. run 'conda env create -f environment.yml' or the full path to the yml file as 'conda env create -f "full/path/to/environment.yml"'
6. Once environment is created, activate it in Anaconda Prompt by running 'conda activate ai_biomech'
7. I recommend running the script in spyder. You can do this by opening Spyder via the Anaconda GUI, or by simply running 'spyder' in Anaconda Prompt.
8. Download 'shoulder_assessment_final.py' to a location of your choosing and open it in spyder. Make sure that you change your directory in spyder to align with the 'shoulder_assessment_final.py' location.
9. Check that you are using the right python interpreter by clicking on the wrench icon, and then 'Python Interpreter'. It should be pointing to the python.exe file in the ai_biomech environment.
10. Run the script and follow the prompts.
11. Once you have been guided through the assessment, check the output csv file to see your results.
